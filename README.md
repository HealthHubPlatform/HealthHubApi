# Pre-reqs
To build and run this app locally you will need a few things:
- Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- Install [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

# Getting started
- Install dependencies
```
cd <project_name>
npm install
```
- Build and run the project
```
npm run build
npm start
```
Or, if you're using VS Code, you can use `cmd + shift + b` to run the default build task (which is mapped to `npm run build`), and then you can use the command palette (`cmd + shift + p`) and select `Tasks: Run Task` > `npm: start` to run `npm start` for you.

> **Note on editors!** - TypeScript has great support in [every editor](http://www.typescriptlang.org/index.html#download-links), but this project has been pre-configured for use with [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).
Throughout the README We will try to call out specific places where VS Code really shines or where this project has been setup to take advantage of specific features.

Finally, navigate to `http://localhost:8080` and you should see the template being served and rendered locally!

# TypeScript + Node
In the next few sections I will call out everything that changes when adding TypeScript to an Express project.
Note that all of this has already been setup for this project, but feel free to use this as a reference for converting other Node.js projects to TypeScript.

## Getting TypeScript
TypeScript itself is simple to add to any project with `npm`.
```
npm install -D typescript
```
If you're using VS Code then you're good to go!
VS Code will detect and use the TypeScript version you have installed in your `node_modules` folder.
For other editors, make sure you have the corresponding [TypeScript plugin](http://www.typescriptlang.org/index.html#download-links).

## Project Structure
The most obvious difference in a TypeScript + Node project is the folder structure.
In a TypeScript project, it's best to have separate _source_  and _distributable_ files.
TypeScript (`.ts`) files live in your `src` folder and after compilation are output as JavaScript (`.js`) in the `dist` folder.
The `test` folder remain top level as expected.

## Running the build
All the different build steps are orchestrated via [npm scripts](https://docs.npmjs.com/misc/scripts).
Npm scripts basically allow us to call (and chain) terminal commands via npm.
This is nice because most JavaScript tools have easy to use command line utilities allowing us to not need grunt or gulp to manage our builds.
If you open `package.json`, you will see a `scripts` section with all the different scripts you can call.
To call a script, simply run `npm run <script-name>` from the command line.
You'll notice that npm scripts can call each other which makes it easy to compose complex builds out of simple individual build scripts.
Below is a list of all the scripts this template has available:


| Npm Script | Description |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `start`                   | Does the same as 'npm run serve'. Can be invoked with `npm start`                                 |
| `build`                   | Full build. Runs ALL build tasks (`build-ts`, `lint`)                                             |
| `serve`                   | Runs node on `dist/server.js` which is the apps entry point                                       |
| `watch-node`              | Runs node with nodemon so the process restarts if it crashes. Used in the main watch task         |
| `watch`                   | Runs all watch tasks (TypeScript, Sass, Node). Use this if you're not touching static assets.     |
| `test`                    | Runs tests using Jest test runner                                                                 |
| `watch-test`              | Runs tests in watch mode                                                                          |
| `build-ts`                | Compiles all source `.ts` files to `.js` files in the `dist` folder                               |
| `watch-ts`                | Same as `build-ts` but continuously watches `.ts` files and re-compiles when needed               |
| `lint`                    | Runs ESLint on project files                                                                      |
| `debug`                   | Performs a full build and then serves the app in watch mode                                       |
| `serve-debug`             | Runs the app with the --inspect flag                                                              |
| `watch-debug`             | The same as `watch` but includes the --inspect flag so you can attach a debugger                  |

## Debugging
Debugging TypeScript is exactly like debugging JavaScript with one caveat, you need source maps.

### Source maps
Source maps allow you to drop break points in your TypeScript source code and have that break point be hit by the JavaScript that is being executed at runtime.

> **Note!** - Source maps aren't specific to TypeScript.
Anytime JavaScript is transformed (transpiled, compiled, optimized, minified, etc) you need source maps so that the code that is executed at runtime can be _mapped_ back to the source that generated it.

The best part of source maps is when configured correctly, you don't even know they exist! So let's take a look at how we do that in this project.

#### Configuring source maps
First you need to make sure your `tsconfig.json` has source map generation enabled:
```json
"compilerOptions" {
    "sourceMap": true
}
```
With this option enabled, next to every `.js` file that the TypeScript compiler outputs there will be a `.map.js` file as well.
This `.map.js` file provides the information necessary to map back to the source `.ts` file while debugging.

> **Note!** - It is also possible to generate "inline" source maps using `"inlineSourceMap": true`.
This is more common when writing client side code because some bundlers need inline source maps to preserve the mapping through the bundle.
Because we are writing Node.js code, we don't have to worry about this.

### Using the debugger in VS Code
Debugging is one of the places where VS Code really shines over other editors.
Node.js debugging in VS Code is easy to setup and even easier to use.
This project comes pre-configured with everything you need to get started.

When you hit `F5` in VS Code, it looks for a top level `.vscode` folder with a `launch.json` file.
In this file, you can tell VS Code exactly what you want to do:
```json
{
    "type": "node",
    "request": "attach",
    "name": "Attach by Process ID",
    "processId": "${command:PickProcess}",
    "protocol": "inspector"
}
```
This is mostly identical to the "Node.js: Attach by Process ID" template with one minor change.
We added `"protocol": "inspector"` which tells VS Code that we're using the latest version of Node which uses a new debug protocol.

With this file in place, you can hit `F5` to attach a debugger.
You will probably have multiple node processes running, so you need to find the one that shows `node dist/server.js`.
Now just set your breakpoints and go!

## Testing
For this project, I chose [Jest](https://facebook.github.io/jest/) as our test framework.
While Mocha is probably more common, Mocha seems to be looking for a new maintainer and setting up TypeScript testing in Jest is wicked simple.

### Install the components
To add TypeScript + Jest support, first install a few npm packages:
```
npm install -D jest ts-jest
```
`jest` is the testing framework itself, and `ts-jest` is just a simple function to make running TypeScript tests a little easier.

### Configure Jest
Jest's configuration lives in `jest.config.js`, so let's open it up and add the following code:
```js
module.exports = {
    globals: {
        'ts-jest': {
            tsConfigFile: 'tsconfig.json'
        }
    },
    moduleFileExtensions: [
        'ts',
        'js'
    ],
    transform: {
        '^.+\\.(ts|tsx)$': './node_modules/ts-jest/preprocessor.js'
    },
    testMatch: [
        '**/test/**/*.test.(ts|js)'
    ],
    testEnvironment: 'node'
};
```
Basically we are telling Jest that we want it to consume all files that match the pattern `"**/test/**/*.test.(ts|js)"` (all `.test.ts`/`.test.js` files in the `test` folder), but we want to preprocess the `.ts` files first.
This preprocess step is very flexible, but in our case, we just want to compile our TypeScript to JavaScript using our `tsconfig.json`.
This all happens in memory when you run the tests, so there are no output `.js` test files for you to manage.

### Running tests
Simply run `npm run test`.
Note this will also generate a coverage report.

### Writing tests
Writing tests for web apps has entire books dedicated to it and best practices are strongly influenced by personal style, so I'm deliberately avoiding discussing how or when to write tests in this guide.
However, if prescriptive guidance on testing is something that you're interested in, [let me know](https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/LN2CV82), I'll do some homework and get back to you.

## ESLint
ESLint is a code linter which mainly helps catch quickly minor code quality and style issues.

### ESLint rules
Like most linters, ESLint has a wide set of configurable rules as well as support for custom rule sets.
All rules are configured through `.eslintrc` configuration file.
In this project, we are using a fairly basic set of rules with no additional custom rules.

### Running ESLint
Like the rest of our build steps, we use npm scripts to invoke ESLint.
To run ESLint you can call the main build script or just the ESLint task.
```
npm run build   // runs full build including ESLint
npm run lint    // runs only ESLint
```
Notice that ESLint is not a part of the main watch task.

If you are interested in seeing ESLint feedback as soon as possible, I strongly recommend the [VS Code ESLint extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dbaeumer.vscode-eslint).
